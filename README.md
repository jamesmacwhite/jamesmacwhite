### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [James White](https://www.jmwhite.co.uk), the running joke that you can express my last name in hexidecimal (#FFFFFF). I'm a Web Developer based in Nottingham, UK. I currently work for [Nottingham College](https://github.com/nottinghamcollege).

I love open source and contribute to many projects which I use personally or have an interest in.
